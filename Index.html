            <h2>Become A Web Developer</h2>
            <p>
                In short, my interest and the possibility of coding drive me to learn. IT-related stuff is everywhere nowadays, websites, smartphone apps, software…etc. Coding can be utilised to build plenty of stuff. Also, it helps to shape your mind to be more logical. Personally speaking, websites seem more interesting which I can handle UI and data at the same time. Therefore, I just dive in to take part in a <strong>Programming Hero</strong> course. Some people think bootcamp is all the cure. In my perspective, if you don’t put much effort after lectures, especially when you are starting from zero, bootcamp doesn’t help a lot.
